Run the project with the following command:

```sh {"id":"01J73PGX21K90GG6S8YG0DTF1N"}
go run main.go
```

Test the API endpoint
Once the server is running, open a browser or use a tool like `curl` to make a request to the `/time` endpoint:

- Using a browser: Open `http://localhost:8080/time.`
- Using `curl`:

```sh {"id":"01J73PHKS4KHCPK3Y67KM1W1NR"}
curl http://localhost:8080/time
```
